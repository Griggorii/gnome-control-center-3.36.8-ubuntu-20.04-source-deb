Fixed: now shows access to the camera and microphone in the privacy tab, also suitable for older kernels where the power widget tab has disappeared when using an older but most likely less cluttered kernel

Deb package ubuntu 20.04 generation https://github.com/Griggorii/gnome-control-center-3.36.8-ubuntu-20.04-update-new/releases/tag/ubuntu-20.04

Less littered core that does not have a problem with bluetooth audio devices and changing audio outputs in a vaylan session if you need to record video from the screen https://github.com/Griggorii/linux-image-5.12.0-stable
